# Homelabbing - Example setups for DIY self hosting of cloud-like services on your computers in your home

In this repository we document techniques for hosting cloud-like open source services, on your own computer(s), in your own home.  We can take back control over our data, and our lives, with this software.  Big Tech wants to control our lives by controlling where we store our data.  The open source world has software that's roughly the equivalent to what Big Tech offers.  When we host these services oursevles, we get to decide where our data lives, how much data we store, who gets to see it, who gets to benefit from it, and more.
